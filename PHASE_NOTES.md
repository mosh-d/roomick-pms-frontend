# Phase Notes

Application-level build log — what's been built, in what order, and why. Component-level decisions live in `design-system/` instead (each doc there covers one component/pattern in depth); this file is for pages, routing, API integration, and cross-cutting architecture. Mirrors the backend's own `PHASE_NOTES.md` convention.

## Phase 1 — Design System (2026-08-21 to 2026-08-22)

### Delivered
- Next.js 16 scaffold (App Router, Turbopack), Tailwind v4 tokens matching the brand spec (8-color palette, Satoshi/Playfair Display typography, the card-nesting opacity mechanic).
- Component library in `components/ui/`: Button, Card, Input, Textarea, Select, YesNoToggle, MultiSelectTagInput, RadioCard, BrandRadioCard, LogoUpload, FormSection, Section, EntryCard, FeatureCard, StatusTag, Text, Container, Icons.
- `/style-guide` route — the live verification surface for every component/token/state; the primary way UI work here gets checked (screenshotted and interacted with, not just read as code).
- `lib/deriveRoomStatus.ts` — single source of truth for the composite room-status badge (3 backend columns → 1 display value).
- Zustand + TanStack Query installed, `QueryClientProvider` wired in `app/providers.tsx`. No real store/query exists yet — nothing to hold until a real feature needs it.

### Decisions & deviations
1. **Several early components were built from partial/cropped reference screenshots instead of the full `Roomick-UI.pdf`**, and every one of them needed correcting once the full 35-page PDF actually got rendered and reviewed page-by-page (`pdftoppm`/poppler-utils isn't installed in this environment and a Chocolatey install fails on permissions — `pip install --user pymupdf` + rendering via `fitz`/`pymupdf` in Python is the working alternative). Corrected: Input/Select/Textarea's field anatomy, RadioCard's entire structure, BrandRadioCard's invented option descriptions, EntryCard's tint, whether `Section` exists as a pattern at all. **Lesson carried forward, saved to memory**: check `Roomick PMS/references/` (the PDF + `pms-frontend-structure-2.html` + the DB/frontend architecture docs) before building or changing anything here, not after.
2. **Real field anatomy** (once corrected): underline style, not bordered boxes — label above, value, bottom-border-only underline, info icon below-left, `focus-within` secondary-tint background instead of a focus ring.
3. **`RadioCard`: one rendering path, no variant prop.** Options render inline on one row (not stacked); the selected option's content renders once below the whole row, not nested per-option. Whether an option gets full card chrome (title + description, tinted) is driven by whether it has a `description` — data, not a flag.
4. **Card nesting uses dark-variant tints** (`primary-dark`/`secondary`/`accent-dark`), not the base brand colors — base-color tints compounded toward a pastel that lost contrast against `text-secondary-light` at nesting depth (a real legibility bug, caught in the style guide). `primary-light` is reserved specifically for `Section` wrappers and whole-page Review/Summary contexts — never for ordinary nested content inside a `Section` (that's `secondary`, to avoid "mixing" same-hue tints).
5. **Primary buttons use white text**, not the WCAG-driven `text-secondary` an earlier pass chose — the actual reference imagery (Confirm Check-In, the Check-In nav panel) uses white, and consistency with the reference won out. Documented, accepted contrast tradeoff (~2.45:1), same treatment as the VIP badge in `StatusTag`.

### Carried forward
- Real app pages (auth, onboarding wizard, Front Desk) — Phase 2, below.
- API client / env plumbing (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, fetch wrapper, auth token storage) — nothing calls the backend live yet.
- Nav/app-shell (solid-primary panel pattern, noted in `design-system/04-components/cards.md`, not built — don't confuse it with `Section`'s translucent tint).
- A real icon set for `FeatureCard` — currently reuses placeholder icons from `Icons.tsx`.

### How to verify this phase
```
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000/style-guide
npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run build
```

## Phase 2 — Signup, step 1: Owner Account (2026-08-22)

### Delivered
- `lib/api.ts` — `apiFetch()` fetch wrapper + `ApiError` class matching the backend's `ProblemJsonExceptionFilter` response shape exactly (`{ type, title, status, code, detail?, errors? }`, RFC 9457). `ApiErrorCode` is a hand-maintained literal union mirroring the backend's `error-codes.ts` (no shared-types package between the two repos yet).
- `lib/schemas/auth.ts` — Zod schemas mirroring `register.dto.ts`/`verify-email.dto.ts` field-for-field (including the subdomain regex and the exact password rule), so client-side validation rejects the same inputs the server would.
- `app/signup/page.tsx` — a real, working two-step flow: Owner Account Form (`POST /auth/register`) → Verify Email (`POST /auth/verify-email`), built with RHF + `zodResolver` + the design-system components, wired to the actual backend endpoints — not a mock.
- `.env.local`/`.env.example` — `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
- Demo vs. real signup choice — a plain inline `RadioCard` row ("Try a demo" / "Get started") shown before the Owner Account form; picking demo just sets `isDemo: true` in the `/auth/register` payload. Backend support (auto-expiry + `DELETE /tenants/me`) landed the same day — see `roomick-pms-backend/PHASE_NOTES.md`'s "Demo tenants + delete organization" entry.

### Decisions & deviations
1. **Built against the real backend DTO, not the reference doc's staged payload.** `pms-frontend-structure-2.html`'s Owner Account Form example doesn't include `subdomain`/`groupName` (it stages those into a separate "Step 2 — Hotel Structure Selection"); the actual `RegisterDto` needs both in the one `/auth/register` call. One combined "Owner account" + "Organization" form, matching what the endpoint actually requires.
2. **The verification token is pre-filled in the UI, visibly and with an explanation**, not hidden — `VerifyEmailDto`'s own comment says the token is "stubbed in MVP" (no email-sending infrastructure exists yet), so pretending otherwise would just be confusing. This is a deliberate, temporary dev convenience called out in the UI copy itself; remove the pre-fill once real email delivery exists.
3. **No session/login wiring yet, on purpose.** Neither `register()` nor `verify-email` returns an access token (confirmed against the real backend — see Phase 1's note on this same mismatch), so there's nothing to store yet. `/auth/login` is the actual dependency for that, and login isn't built.

### Verified
Real Playwright run against the live backend + local Postgres (not a mock): filled the form, `POST /auth/register` → 201, token pre-filled, `POST /auth/verify-email` → 200, reached the confirmation step — then confirmed the row actually landed in `tenants` via a direct `psql` query. Zero console/page errors. Re-verified with the demo toggle on: `isDemo`/`demoExpiresAt` confirmed correctly persisted from a real UI submission (not just a direct API call).

**A second reference/backend mismatch, same shape as the first**: `pms-frontend-structure-2.html`'s `/tenants/configure-mode` payload example is `{ mode: "single_brand"|"multi_brand", groupName, primaryBrandName }`. The real `ConfigureModeDto` is `{ mode: "single"|"multi", brandName? }` — different enum values, different field names, one fewer field. Caught the same way as the first one: by actually calling the live endpoint rather than trusting the doc. Building the Organization Structure step (next phase) needs to read `configure-mode.dto.ts` directly, not the reference doc's example.

**Local dev note**: the backend and frontend now correctly run on their intended ports (backend 3000, frontend 3001 — see this file's README section) — for most of this project's life they'd both been defaulting to 3000, which went unnoticed until wiring a real API call actually required both running simultaneously.

### Carried forward
- Rest of the onboarding wizard: Organization Structure (Brand Mode), Branch Setup, Room Types/Rooms, Review — confirmed against `pms-frontend-structure-2.html`'s API contract (`/tenants/configure-mode`, `/brands/:id/branches`, `/buildings/:id/floors`, `/branches/:id/room-types`, `/branches/:id/rooms/bulk`).
- `/login` page — needed before any authenticated route can be built (nothing issues a usable access token before it).
- Auth token storage/session strategy — not decided yet; needs `/login` to exist first to have something to store.

**Security note** (from before this phase started): the backend's `/auth/register` (and `/login`/`/verify-email`/`/refresh`/`/accept-invite`) is rate-limited (`@nestjs/throttler`) — `register()` provisions a full tenant + owner + 6 roles per call, not a plain insert, so leaving it fully open while a public form exists in front of it was a real gap, not a theoretical one. See `roomick-pms-backend/PHASE_NOTES.md`'s "Hardening — Auth rate limiting" entry.
