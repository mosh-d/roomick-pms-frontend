# Phase Notes

Application-level build log — what's been built, in what order, and why. Component-level decisions live in `design-system/` instead (each doc there covers one component/pattern in depth); this file is for pages, routing, API integration, and cross-cutting architecture. Mirrors the backend's own `PHASE_NOTES.md` convention.

## Phase 1 — Design System (2026-08-21 to 2026-08-22)

### Delivered
- Next.js 16 scaffold (App Router, Turbopack), Tailwind v4 tokens matching the brand spec (8-color palette, Satoshi/Playfair Display typography, the card-nesting opacity mechanic).
- Component library in `components/ui/`: Button, Card, Input, Textarea, Select, YesNoToggle, MultiSelectTagInput, RadioCard, BrandRadioCard, LogoUpload, FormSection, Section, EntryCard, FeatureCard, StatusTag, Text, Container, Icons.
- `/style-guide` route — the live verification surface for every component/token/state; the primary way UI work here gets checked (screenshotted and interacted with, not just read as code).
- `lib/deriveRoomStatus.ts` — single source of truth for the composite room-status badge (3 backend columns → 1 display value).
- Zustand + TanStack Query installed, `QueryClientProvider` wired in `app/providers.tsx`. No real store/query exists yet — nothing to hold until a real feature needs it.

### Decisions & deviations
1. **Several early components were built from partial/cropped reference screenshots instead of the full `Roomick-UI.pdf`**, and every one of them needed correcting once the full 35-page PDF actually got rendered and reviewed page-by-page (`pdftoppm`/poppler-utils isn't installed in this environment and a Chocolatey install fails on permissions — `pip install --user pymupdf` + rendering via `fitz`/`pymupdf` in Python is the working alternative). Corrected: Input/Select/Textarea's field anatomy, RadioCard's entire structure, BrandRadioCard's invented option descriptions, EntryCard's tint, whether `Section` exists as a pattern at all. **Lesson carried forward, saved to memory**: check `Roomick PMS/references/` (the PDF + `pms-frontend-structure-2.html` + the DB/frontend architecture docs) before building or changing anything here, not after.
2. **Real field anatomy** (once corrected): underline style, not bordered boxes — label above, value, bottom-border-only underline, info icon below-left, `focus-within` secondary-tint background instead of a focus ring.
3. **`RadioCard`: one rendering path, no variant prop.** Options render inline on one row (not stacked); the selected option's content renders once below the whole row, not nested per-option. Whether an option gets full card chrome (title + description, tinted) is driven by whether it has a `description` — data, not a flag.
4. **Card nesting uses dark-variant tints** (`primary-dark`/`secondary`/`accent-dark`), not the base brand colors — base-color tints compounded toward a pastel that lost contrast against `text-secondary-light` at nesting depth (a real legibility bug, caught in the style guide). `primary-light` is reserved specifically for `Section` wrappers and whole-page Review/Summary contexts — never for ordinary nested content inside a `Section` (that's `secondary`, to avoid "mixing" same-hue tints).
5. **Primary buttons use white text**, not the WCAG-driven `text-secondary` an earlier pass chose — the actual reference imagery (Confirm Check-In, the Check-In nav panel) uses white, and consistency with the reference won out. Documented, accepted contrast tradeoff (~2.45:1), same treatment as the VIP badge in `StatusTag`.

### Carried forward
- Real app pages (auth, onboarding wizard, Front Desk) — Phase 2, below.
- API client / env plumbing (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, fetch wrapper, auth token storage) — nothing calls the backend live yet.
- Nav/app-shell (solid-primary panel pattern, noted in `design-system/04-components/cards.md`, not built — don't confuse it with `Section`'s translucent tint).
- A real icon set for `FeatureCard` — currently reuses placeholder icons from `Icons.tsx`.

### How to verify this phase
```
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000/style-guide
npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run build
```

### Next (Phase 2 — Auth + Onboarding Wizard)
Confirmed against `Roomick PMS/references/pms-frontend-structure-2.html`: `/signup` (public, no auth required for the route itself) covers Owner Account Form → email verification → Brand Mode → Branch Setup → Room Types/Rooms, and its API contract matches the backend's already-built P1 endpoints (`POST /auth/register`, `/auth/verify-email`, `/tenants/configure-mode`, `/brands/:id/branches`, `/buildings/:id/floors`, `/branches/:id/room-types`, `/branches/:id/rooms/bulk`).

**One reference/backend mismatch already caught**: the doc's `POST /auth/register` response example shows `{ tenantId, userId, token: jwt, verificationRequired }`. The actual backend (`auth.service.ts`) returns `{ tenantId, userId, subdomain, verificationToken }` — no access token until after `/auth/verify-email` succeeds. Build against the backend's real shape, not the doc's, when they disagree.

**Security note**: before wiring the real `/signup` flow, the backend's `/auth/register` (and `/login`/`/verify-email`/`/refresh`/`/accept-invite`) got rate-limited (`@nestjs/throttler`) — `register()` provisions a full tenant + owner + 6 roles per call, not a plain insert, so leaving it fully open while a public form exists in front of it was a real gap, not a theoretical one. See `roomick-pms-backend/PHASE_NOTES.md`'s "Hardening — Auth rate limiting" entry.
